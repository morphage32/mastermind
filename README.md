Mastermind Ruby Project

This project will involve creating a guessing game based on the Mastermind game that is played with two players. One player will create a four-item code based off of different colors, while the other player must attempt to guess the code within a limited number of attempts. In this program, the user should be allowed to play the role of the code-breaker OR the code-maker (allowing the computer to attempt to guess the user's code)
